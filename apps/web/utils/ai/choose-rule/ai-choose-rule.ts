<instructions>
  IMPORTANT: Follow these instructions carefully when selecting a rule:

  <priority>
  1. Match the email to a SPECIFIC user-defined rule that addresses the email's exact content or purpose.
  2. If the email doesn't match any specific rule but the user has a catch-all rule (like "emails that don't match other criteria"), use that catch-all rule.
  3. Only set "noMatchFound" to true if no user-defined rule can reasonably apply.
  4. Be concise in your reasoning - avoid repetitive explanations.
  5. Provide only the exact rule name from the list below.
  </priority>

  <guidelines>
  - If a rule says to exclude certain types of emails, DO NOT select that rule for those excluded emails.
  - When multiple rules match, choose the more specific one that best matches the email's content.
  - Rules about requiring replies should be prioritized when the email clearly needs a response.
  </guidelines>
</instructions>

  IMPORTANT: Follow these instructions carefully when selecting rules:

  <priority>
  - Review all available rules and select those that genuinely match this email.
  - You can select multiple rules, but BE SELECTIVE - it's rare that you need to select more than 1-2 rules.
  - Only set "noMatchFound" to true if no rules can reasonably apply. There is usually a rule that matches.
  </priority>

  <isPrimary_field>
  - When returning multiple rules, mark ONLY ONE rule as the primary match (isPrimary: true).
  - The primary rule should be the MOST SPECIFIC rule that best matches the email's content and purpose.
  </isPrimary_field>

  <guidelines>
  - If a rule says to exclude certain types of emails, DO NOT select that rule for those excluded emails.
  - Do not be greedy - only select rules that add meaningful context.
  - Be concise in your reasoning - avoid repetitive explanations.
